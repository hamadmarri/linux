The Cachy Scheduler by Hamad Al Marri.
======================================

1.  Overview
=============

Cachy scheduler is a CFS-based cpu process scheduler that utilizes CPU cache
and it is based on Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) policy.

1.1 About Cachy Scheduler
--------------------------

  - All balancing code is removed except for idle CPU balancing. There is no
    periodic balancing, only idle CPU balancing is applied. Once a task is
    assigned to a CPU, it sticks with it until another CPUS got idle then this
    task might get pulled to new cpu. The reason of disabling periodic balancing
    is to utilize the CPU cache of tasks.

  - No grouping for tasks, FAIR_GROUP_SCHED must be disabled.

  - No support for NUMA, NUMA must be disabled.

  - Each CPU has its own runqueue.

  - NORMAL runqueue is a linked list of sched_entities (instead of RB-Tree).

  - RT and other runqueues are just the same as the CFS's.

  - A task gets preempted in every tick. If the clock ticks in 250HZ
    (i.e. CONFIG_HZ_250=y) then a task runs for 4 milliseconds and then got
    preempted if there are other tasks in the runqueue.

  - Wake up tasks preempt currently running tasks if its HRRN value is higher.

  - This scheduler is designed for desktop usage since it is about
    responsiveness. It may be not bad for servers.

  - Cachy might be good for mobiles or Android since it has high responsiveness.
    Cachy need to be integrated to Android, I don't think the current version
    it is ready to go without some tweeking and adapting to Android hacks.

1.2. Complexity
----------------

The complexity of Enqueue and Dequeue a task is O(1).

The complexity of pick the next task is in O(n), where n is the number of tasks
in a runqueue (each CPU has its own runqueue).

Note: O(n) sounds scary, but usually for a machine with 4 CPUS where it is used
for desktop or mobile jobs, the maximum number of runnable tasks might not
exceeds 10 (at the pick next run time) - the idle tasks are excluded since they
are dequeued when sleeping and enqueued when they wake up. The Cachy scheduler
latency for a high number of CPUs (4+) is usually less than the CFS's since no
tree balancing nor tasks balancing are required - again for desktop and mobile
usage.


2. The Cachy Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) policy
=======================================================

Cachy is based in Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) policy with some
modifications. HRRN is a scheduling policy in which the process that has the
highest response ratio will run next.

Each process has a response ratio value R = (w_t + s_t) / s_t where w_t is
the process waiting time, and s_t is the process running
time. If two process has similar running times, the
process that has been waiting longer will run first. HRRN aims
to prevent starvation since it strives the waiting time for processes,
and also it increases the response time.

If two processes have the same R after integer rounding, the division remainder
is compared. See below the full
calculation for R value:

	u64 r_curr, r_se, w_curr = 1ULL, w_se = 1ULL;
	struct task_struct *t_curr = task_of(curr);
	struct task_struct *t_se = task_of(se);
	u64 vr_curr   = curr->hrrn_sum_exec_runtime + 1;
	u64 vr_se   = se->hrrn_sum_exec_runtime   + 1;
	s64 diff;

	diff = now - curr->hrrn_start_time;
	if (diff > 0)
		w_curr  = diff;

	diff = now - se->hrrn_start_time;
	if (diff > 0)
		w_se  = diff;

	// adjusting for priorities
	w_curr  *= (140 - t_curr->prio);
	w_se  *= (140 - t_se->prio);

	r_curr  = w_curr / vr_curr;
	r_se  = w_se / vr_se;
	diff  = r_se - r_curr;

	// take the remainder if equal
	if (diff == 0)
	{
		r_curr  = w_curr % vr_curr;
		r_se  = w_se % vr_se;
		diff  = r_se - r_curr;
	}

	if (diff > 0)
		return 1;

	return -1;

2.1 More about HRRN algorithm
------------------------------

The Highest response ratio next (HRRN) scheduling is a non-preemptive
discipline. It was developed by Brinch Hansen as modification of shortest job
next (SJN) to mitigate the problem of process starvation. `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_response_ratio_next>`_.

The original HRRN is non-preemptive meaning that a task runs until it finishes.
This nature is not good for interactive systems. Applying original HRRN with
preemptive modifications requires two changes.

First, what happens if the scheduler forces a task to preempt every tick? This
can work great for short amount of time lets say (< 60 minutes) until some
tasks ages and new tasks created, then the imbalance happens. Assume one task
T1 (Xorg) is running and waiting for users inputs.

This task will have high HRRN because it sleeps more than it runs, however,
after a long time (say 60 minuets = 3600000000000ns) the life time of T1 is
3600000000000ns lets assume the sum of execution time is 50% = 1800000000000ns.

The HRRN = 3600000000000 / 1800000000000 = 2.
If T1 runs for 4ms, the rate of change on HRRN is too low:
HRRN = 3600000000000 / 1800004000000 = 1.999995556

Also, if T1 waited for 1s HRRN = 3601000000000 / 1800004000000 = 2.00055111,
the rate of change is low too. Both situations are bad, because:

1. A new task T2 will have higher HRRN when it starts, thus it will be picked
instead of T1.

2. The rate of change of T2 compared to T1 is higher.

This situation is not good for infinite processes such as Xorg and desktop
related threads. Those task must run ASAP when they wake up, because they are
related to responsiveness and Interactivity.

Therefore, the original HRRN needs some modifications.


3. HRRN Tunables
=================

We have implemented two modifications that enhances HRRN to work as a preemptive
policy:


3.1 HRRN maximum life time
---------------------------

Instead of calculating a task HRRN value for infinite life time, we proposed
hrrn_max_lifetime which is 10s by default. A task's hrrn_start_time and
hrrn_sum_exec_runtime reset every 10s. Therefore, the rate of change of HRRN
for old and new tasks is normalized. The value hrrn_max_lifetime can be changed
at run time by the following sysctl command:

	sysctl kernel.sched_hrrn_max_lifetime_ms=60000

The value is in milliseconds, the above command changes hrrn_max_lifetime from 10s
to 60s.


3.2 HRRN latency
-----------------

A new task could overcome old tasks because it has 1 sum execution, and lets say
its age is few microseconds 7000ns (7us). This new task will have HRRN = 7000 which
is high compared with older tasks. That's why we proposed hrrn_latency which is in
microseconds. When a new task is forked, the hrrn_start_time is set to (current
time in nano + hrrn_latency). The default value of hrrn_latency is 0. This value
can be changed by the following:

	sysctl kernel.sched_hrrn_latency_us=6000

This sets hrrn_latency to 6ms. Notice that a new task will have HRRN=1 for this
period of time. Notice also that if no runnable tasks other than this new task, this
task will run. Adding 6ms doesn't mean that a new task will pause for 6ms.
It means it will have HRRN=1 or 0 for 6ms. It depends on how many other task on
the run queue and whether they have higher HRRN or not. This will solve a
problem when having heavy compilation with -j5 on 4CPUS machine. The compilation
will create new threads for each file and that might cause freezes and hangups.
Technically those new threads could have higher HRRN values than Xorg or whatever
old running desktop tasks.

Having said that, the default value is 0, on my machine this value doesn't make
any problems and I don't have any freezes when compiling kernel unless I changed
it to -500000000. It depends on your machine and on how fast is your HD drive.


4. Priorities
==============

The priorities are applied as the followings:

  - The wait time is calculated and then multiplied by (140 - t_curr->prio)
    wheret_curr is the task.

  - Highest priority in NORMAL policy is 100 so the wait is multiplied by
    140 - 100 = 40.

  - Normal priority in NORMAL policy is 120 so the wait is multiplied by
    140 - 120 = 20.

  - Lowest priority is 139 so the wait is multiplied by 140 - 139 = 1.

This calculation is applied for all task in NORMAL policy where they range from
100 - 139. After the multiplication, wait is divided by s_t
(the sum_exec_runtime + 1).


5. Scheduling policies
=======================

Cachy some CFS, implements three scheduling policies:

  - SCHED_NORMAL (traditionally called SCHED_OTHER): The scheduling
    policy that is used for regular tasks.

  - SCHED_BATCH: Does not preempt nearly as often as regular tasks
    would, thereby allowing tasks to run longer and make better use of
    caches but at the cost of interactivity. This is well suited for
    batch jobs.

  - SCHED_IDLE: This is even weaker than nice 19, but its not a true
    idle timer scheduler in order to avoid to get into priority
    inversion problems which would deadlock the machine.

SCHED_FIFO/_RR are implemented in sched/rt.c and are as specified by
POSIX.

The command chrt from util-linux-ng 2.13.1.1 can set all of these except
SCHED_IDLE.
